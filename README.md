## Story

In a distant future, a catastrophic event known as the Great Mushroom War devastated the world, leaving behind only ruins and magic. From the ashes, a new land emerged: the Land of Ooo, a wonderful and magical place filled with peculiar creatures, mystical powers, and fantastic landscapes.

At the heart of this post-apocalyptic world lay the Candy Kingdom, ruled by the benevolent Princess Bubblegum, where candy canes sprouted from the ground, and gingerbread houses adorned the landscape.

However, even in this magical realm, danger lurked in the shadows. The Ice King, a mad wizard who was once a scientist before the Mushroom War, sought to capture princesses to make them his brides. He was aided in his nefarious plans by his loyal penguins, who helped him construct traps and elaborate devices to achieve his goals.

Despite these dangers, Finn the Human is a fearless adventurer who travels through the Land of Ooo, seeking adventure and helping those in need.
